# browserify-export-example
Example of browserify with export. `require()` is split into reqs.js, which is used as the input to browserify for fetching all dependencies. reqs.js is prepended to index.js, so whatever is exposed in reqs.js will be available. prelude.js is a custom prelude used for the browserify, it basically changes the function to instead return a requires function for our reqs.js. We can't assign that to require straight away though since that would lead to infinite recursion if a module can't be found, instead it's assigned to a temporary `__tmpReq`, which afterwards is assigned to `require`. To test the example run `npm install` followed by `npm run-script build`, then just run `index.html` in your favorite browser.
